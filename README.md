# BERT Financial Sentiment Classifier

## Overview

This repository provides a BERT based model fine-tuned for financial sentiment classification tasks. It leverages the power of transformer-based architectures to analyze and classify financial text data, such as news articles, earnings reports, and analyst opinions, into sentiment categories.

## Features

- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Utilizes BERT for contextual understanding of financial texts.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Includes scripts for cleaning and preparing financial datasets.
- **Training Scripts**: Provides code to fine-tune the BERT model on financial sentiment datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements functions to assess model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install transformers torch pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset
The model is designed to work with financial sentiment datasets. The repository includes scripts to load and preprocess datasets for training and evaluation.

## Usage
## Training the Model
To train the model on your dataset, run the following command:

```
python train.py --model_name "bert-base-uncased" --batch_size 16 --epochs 3 --learning_rate 2e-5 --dataset_path "path_to_your_dataset.csv"
```

## Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model's performance using:

```
python evaluate.py --model_path "path_to_trained_model" --test_data "path_to_test_dataset.csv"
```
Replace "path_to_trained_model" with the path to your saved model and "path_to_test_dataset.csv" with your test dataset.
